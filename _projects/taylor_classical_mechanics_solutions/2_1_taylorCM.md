# When they are Equal
Equation 2.7 gives the ratio of the quadratic to linear drag force.

$$ \frac{f_\text{quad}}{f_\text{lin}}= \frac{\gamma D}{\beta}v$$

We want to find when $f_\text{quad}$ and $f_\text{lin}$ are equally important. This happens when they are nearly equal in size, or $ \frac{f_\text{quad}}{f_\text{lin}} = 1$.

 The problem gave $D$ while $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are constants, so all we need to do is solve 

$$ 1= \frac{\gamma D}{\beta}v$$

for v. Solving,

$$ v= \frac{\beta}{\gamma D}. $$


# When is it Safe to Ignore $f_\text{lin}$?

We can ignore when $f_\text{lin} << f_\text{quad}$. So for speeds greater than what we found above are safe.
