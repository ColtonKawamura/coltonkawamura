# Part a

We are given mass $$m$$ and $$k$$ and solving for $$\omega$$, $$f$$, and $$\tau$$ which are all related, so we might as well start by solving for $$\omega$$. We know that we can get $$\omega$$ with,  

$$ \omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}. $$  

And then get $$f$$ with,  

$$ f = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}. $$  

Then get the period by  

$$ \tau = \frac{1}{f}. $$  

# Part b

When the initial position $$x(t) = 0$$,  

$$ 0 = A \cos(0 - \delta). $$  

Since $$A \neq 0$$ (it's oscillating!), the above relation is only true when  

$$ 0 = \cos(\delta) $$  

because $$\cos$$ is even. This only happens when  

$$ \delta = \pm n \pi / 2. $$  

With initial velocity $$v_0$$,  

$$ v_0 = -A\omega\sin(0-\delta) $$  

and since $$\sin$$ is odd, the $$-$$ can move out of the function to make  

$$ v_0 = +A\omega\sin(\delta). $$  

We know what $$\delta$$ is now, so let's solve for $$A$$. Since $$\sin(\pm n \pi / 2) = \pm 1$$,  

$$ v_0 = \pm A\omega. $$  

But we were given a positive initial velocity, so that means,  

$$ A = \frac{v_0}{\omega}, $$  

and we choose the positive $$\delta$$,  

$$ \delta = \frac{n \pi}{2}. $$
