I'm a father of three kids that don't sleep, a proud husband, and a physics researcher.

I earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in physics where I concentrated on computational analysis of theoretical energetic materials.

My current research focuses are effects of granular packing on sediment acoustics and leveraging optimal control theory in drone swarm defense.
