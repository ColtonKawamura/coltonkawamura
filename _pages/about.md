I'm a father of three kids that don't sleep and a proud husband.

I'm also an engineer in the defense sector and develop scientific software for large scale modeling and simulations.

I earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in physics where I concentrated on computational analysis of theoretical energetic materials.
