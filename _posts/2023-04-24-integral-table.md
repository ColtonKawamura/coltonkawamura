$$
\int A x^2 \sin^2(kx) \, dx = \frac{A}{6} x^3 - \frac{A}{4k^2} x^2 \sin(2kx) - \frac{A}{4k^3} x \cos(2kx) + \frac{A}{8k^3} \sin(2kx) + C.
$$

**Definite Integrals**

$$
\int_0^\pi \cos^2(x) \, dx = \frac{\pi}{2}
$$

The area under $$\cos$$ and $$\cos^2$$ is $$\pi$$ times the amplitude. Since our amplitude is only $$1$$ and the range is only have of a full cycle, the area under is $$\pi/2$$. So for a full cycle, it should be twice a half-cycle, or $$\pi$$, so,

$$
\int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2(x) \, dx = \pi.
$$
