# Simulating Flow Over a Cylinder Using MATLAB and the Lattice Boltzmann Method

## Introduction

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a powerful tool used to analyze fluid flow problems. In this tutorial, we'll simulate **2D flow past a cylinder** using **MATLAB** and the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)** to compute the drag coefficient. We'll also visualize velocity fields and streamline patterns.

## Problem Setup

We'll analyze the flow past a cylinder with the following parameters:

```matlab
% Problem Parameters
D = 1.0;            % Cylinder diameter (m)
U = 1.0;            % Free-stream velocity (m/s)
rho = 1.0;          % Fluid density (kg/m^3)
mu = 0.01;          % Dynamic viscosity (Pa.s)
Re = rho * U * D / mu; % Reynolds number

% Domain size
Lx = 20;  % Length of domain in x-direction
Ly = 10;  % Height of domain in y-direction

fprintf('Reynolds number: %.2f\n', Re);
