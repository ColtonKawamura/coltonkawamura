This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in markdown code tags:

````markdown
```c++
code code code
```
````

```c++
% Define the two figure files that are on the MATLAB path
% These are the only "inputs" to this script
f1 = 'bi.fig';
f2 = 'poly.fig';

% Open the figures
fig1 = openfig(f1);
fig2 = openfig(f2);

% get axes handles - this assumes there is only 1 axes per figure!
fig1ax = gca(fig1);
fig2ax = gca(fig2);
leg1 = findobj(fig1,'Type','legend');
leg2 = findobj(fig2,'Type','legend');

% Get axis children
fig1axChildren = get(fig1ax,'Children');
fig2axChildren = get(fig2ax,'Children');

% Create new fig, copy items from fig 1
% This will maintain set properties such as color
figFinal = figure();
ax = axes(figFinal);
h1 = copyobj(fig1axChildren, ax);


% Copy items from fig 2
h2 = copyobj(fig2axChildren, ax);
set(gca, 'YScale', 'log')
set(gca, 'XScale', 'log')
grid on


% Add legend to same location as the legend in fig2 
% but only include objects with a defined DisplayName
h = [h2;h1];
hasDisplayName = ~cellfun('isempty',get(h,'DisplayName'));
legend(ax, h(hasDisplayName),'Location', leg1.Location, 'Interpreter', 'Latex')


% Copy axis labels
xlabel(ax, fig2ax.XLabel.String, 'Interpreter', 'Latex', 'FontSize', 20)
ylabel(ax, fig2ax.YLabel.String, 'Interpreter', 'Latex', 'FontSize', 20)
set(get(gca, 'ylabel'), 'rotation', 0);
```

For displaying code in a list item, you have to be aware of the indentation, as stated in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34987908/embed-a-code-block-in-a-list-item-with-proper-indentation-in-kramdown/38090598#38090598). You must indent your code by **(3 \* bullet_indent_level)** spaces. This is because kramdown (the markdown engine used by Jekyll) indentation for the code block in lists is determined by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. For example:

````markdown
1. We can put fenced code blocks inside nested bullets, too.

   1. Like this:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.
````

Which displays:

      ```c
      printf("Hello, World!");
      ```

   2. The key is to indent your fenced block in the same line as the first character of the line.

By default, it does not display line numbers. If you want to display line numbers for every code block, you can set `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.block.line_numbers` to true in your `_config.yml` file.

If you want to display line numbers for a specific code block, all you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

{% raw %}
{% highlight c++ linenos %} <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}

int main(int argc, char const \*argv[])
{
string myString;

    cout << "input a string: ";
    getline(cin, myString);
    int length = myString.length();

    char charArray = new char * [length];

    charArray = myString;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; ++i){
        cout << charArray[i] << " ";
    }

    return 0;

}

{% endhighlight %}
